Polyfill for stream.finished in node versions &lt; v10

node v10.0.0 added support for a built-in `stream.finished`:
<https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/19828>

This package provides the built-in `stream.finished` in node v10.0.0 and later,
and a replacement in other environments.

This package implements the [es-shim API](https://github.com/es-shims/api)
interface. It works in an ES3-supported environment and complies with the
[spec](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/).

## Usage

### Direct

```js
const finished = require('stream.finished');
// Use `finished` just like the built-in method on `stream`
```

### Shim

```js
require('stream.finished/shim')();
// `stream.finished` is now defined
const stream = require('stream');
// Use `stream.finished`
```

or:

```js
require('stream.finished/auto');
// `stream.finished` is now defined
const stream = require('stream');
// Use `stream.finished`
```
